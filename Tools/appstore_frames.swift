//
//  appstore_frames.swift
//  Solitaire tools
//
//  Pulls still frames out of a finished App Preview so the cut can be checked
//  without watching it.
//
//      swift Tools/appstore_frames.swift <video.mp4> <out-dir> <seconds>...
//
//  Every window in the preview is supposed to hold something *moving* from its
//  first frame to its last (see AppStore/screenshots.md). Nothing enforces that:
//  a window that has drifted past the action does not fail, it just goes still.
//  So the check is to look at the frames either side of each cut — which is what
//  this is for, and why it is a tool rather than a line of ffmpeg: ffmpeg is not
//  installed on a stock macOS, and this needs nothing that is not already here.
//
//  Frames come out named after their timestamp (`at-04.90s.png`), so a contact
//  sheet made of them is in order:
//
//      swift Tools/appstore_frames.swift AppStore/preview/en-US/iphone-6.5.mp4 \
//          /tmp/frames 0.1 4.9 5.1 10.4 10.6 15.4 15.6 22.4 22.6 24.9
//      magick montage /tmp/frames/*.png -tile 5x -geometry 200x+4+4 /tmp/sheet.png
//
//  Seeking is tolerant to one frame, not to the nearest keyframe: a keyframe snap
//  can land on the very frame you were trying to rule out. Zero tolerance was
//  tried first and is worse than it sounds — the finished previews are all-intra
//  and seek to the exact frame either way, but the *raw* simulator recordings are
//  variable frame rate, and on those an exact request past about 21 s silently
//  came back with the last frame it could find instead. A frame's worth of slack
//  costs nothing and makes the raw clips seekable, which is where the cut points
//  are actually chosen.
